Things to add to my indie game:

Platforms in the sky to climb
finish adding in the other classes - making the enemy on the screen also



if level_4:
     y = 250
     if x > vel -width...
     ground = 150 # the gaps on platforms     


^^^ this is to help create platforms to allow falling

if y == [the bottom of the screen]:
     health = 0 # falls to death
